## Questions to ask:
- Does the campaign have an effect on the rate of downloads on the *back catalog*?
  - Is this effect greater than the regular bi-weekly increase in downloads due to a new episode being released?
  - Is the WMATA campaign more effective (by this metric) than the Vox/Economist campaign?
- Does the campaign have an effect on the rate of downloads *after the release date* for fully treated episodes?
  - Particular focus on the second week
  - We can look at treated episodes and treated locations
