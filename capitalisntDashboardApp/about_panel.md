# About

The *Capitalisn't* podcast is published via a platform called Simplecast, which distributes the podcast to various other services such as Apple Podcasts and Spotify. Additionally, Simplecast aggregates various podcast statistics and characteristics from each of those platforms, all of which can be accessed via an online API. Though Simplecast automaticlaly produces its own dashboard, our access to the API allows us to customize the way we view that data.

Please see [this](https://apidocs.simplecast.com/) link to see the various kinds of data that are available through the Simplecast API. If there are particular statistics/podcast information you would like to be collected, please let me know so I can begin collection. Letting me know as early as possible is important for some of the statistics because the API only returns cross-sectional data for each episode, location etc. If we are interested in time-series data for each of those units, we need to construct that series ourselves by querying the API at regular intervals.

The ambition is eventually to also make this the location where all of the experiments with the podcast are evaluated so that there is a single source of information that everyone has access to. Those evaluations will be added over time.

Please excuse the dashboard's present appearance. I wanted to get a version of this online as soon as possible. Additional modifications for aesthetic and functional reasons will be made going forward. If you would like to see something changed or a feature added please do [email](mailto:joshualevy@chicagobooth.edu)/Slack me and I will try to have that reflected in the live version as soon as possible.
